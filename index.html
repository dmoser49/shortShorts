        <h2>Heart Sutra</h2>
        <p>
          Avalokiteshvara, who helps all to awaken,
          moves in the deep course of
          realizing wisdom beyond wisdom,
          sees that all five streams of
          body, heart, and mind are without boundary, and frees all from anguish.
          O Shariputra [who listens to the teachings of the Buddha],
          form is not separate from boundlessness;
          boundlessness is not separate from form.
          Form is boundlessness; boundlessness is form.
          Feelings, perceptions, inclinations, and discernment are also like this.
          O Shariputra, boundlessness is the nature of all things.
          It neither arises nor perishes, neither stains nor purifies,
          neither increases nor decreases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Boundlessness is not limited by form,
          nor by feelings, perceptions, inclinations, or discernment.
          It is free of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind;
          free of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and any object of mind;
          free of sensory realms, including the realm of mind.
          it is free of ignorance and the end of ignorance.
          Boundlessness is free of old age and death,
          and free of the end of old age and death.
          It is free of suffering, arising, cessation, and path, and free of wisdom and attainment.

          Being free of attainment, those who help to awaken
          abide in the realization of wisdom beyond wisdom,
          and live with an unhindered mind.
          Without hindrance, the mind has no fear.
          Free from confusion, those who lead all to liberation
          embody profound serenity.
          All those in the past, preset, and future, who realize wisdom beyond wisdom,
          manifest unsurpassable and thorough awakening.

          Know that realizing wisdom beyond wisdom
          is no other than this wondrous mantra,
          luminous, unequalled, and supreme.
          It relives all suffering.
          It is genuine, not illusory.
          So set forth this mantra of realizing wisdom beyond wisdom.
          Set forth this mantra that says:
          GATE, GATE, PARAGATE, PARASAMGATE, BODHI! SVAHA!
